# Jens Mod Installer

This was a project that was made for me and my friend group, we used to play tons of Minecraft and they werent tech savy, so I created this thing as a platform where I can link the mods on list.json for Cracked Miencraft users and Premium MC users (since Premium MC users had to use a bit different mod list) and my friends could download the app and it would download all the mods on the %AppData%/.minecraft/mods.

The APP is very messy, but the code might be useful to some, and hence I made it public.
